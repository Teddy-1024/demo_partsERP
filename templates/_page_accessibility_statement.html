            This wording is legally required and must not be changed.]

        <!--
            [Note: use this section to make a brief, general statement about what the website allows disabled users to do. Base it on the evaluation covered in detail in the ‘Technical information about this website’s accessibility’ section.

        <p>This website is run by {{ model.NAME_COMPANY }}. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
                <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of NVDA and TalkBack)</li>
                <li>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</li>
            
            <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

Try to list in order of most impact to least impact.]

            [Note: if your organisation is based in Northern Ireland, refer users who want to complain to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) instead of the EASS and EHRC.

        <h2>Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
        <!--
            [Note: this wording is legally required and must not be changed.]
        -->
        <p>{{ model.NAME_COMPANY }} is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Compliance status</h3>
        <p>The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.
        </p>
        <!--
            [Note: say that the website is fully compliant if the website meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [2.1 or 2.2] AA standard in full.

            Say that it’s partially compliant if it meets most requirements of the WCAG [2.1 or 2.2] AA standard.

            If it does not meet most requirements of the WCAG [2.1 or 2.2] AA standard, say that it’s not compliant.

            If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant with the WCAG [2.1 or 2.2] AA standard, you’ll need to explain why. This will be due to one or both of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there’s an accessibility problem with it</li>
                <li>an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations, or it’d be a disproportionate burden for you to make it accessible</li>
            </ul>
            There’s a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your website, so do not change it. Choose one of the options below, for example (a), (b) or (c), and delete those not applicable.
        -->
        <p><!-- [Select (a) only if all requirements of the technical specification are fully met without exceptions for WCAG 2.1 or WCAG 2.2.] -->

            (a) This website is fully compliant with the <!--[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard or -->Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.
            <!-- 
            [Select (b) if most requirements of the technical specification are met, but with some exceptions. This means not yet fully compliant and that the necessary measures are to be taken in order to reach full compliance.]
            
            (b) This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard], due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’] listed below.
            
            [Select (c) if most requirements of the technical specification are not met.]
            
            (c) This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard]. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’] are listed below.
            -->
        </p>
        
        <!-- 
        <h2>Non-accessible content</h2>
        <!--
            [Note: if the website is fully compliant with the standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content’ section out.

            Otherwise, do not change the ‘Non-accessible content’ heading or the ‘The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons’ sentence - they’re legally required.

            Do not change the ‘Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations’, ‘Disproportionate burden’ and ‘Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations’ subheadings: they’re also legally required.

            But if you need to list a lot of problems, you can break these subsections up with further subheadings - for example, ‘Navigation and accessing information’ or ‘Interactive tools and transactions’.]
        --
        <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
        <!--
            [Note: In this subsection, list:
            <ul>
                <li>accessibility problems</li>
                <li>which of the WCAG success criteria the problem fails on</li>
                <li>when you plan to fix the problem</li>
            </ul>
            Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).

            These are examples only. Your statement must be specific to your website.]
        --
        <p>Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

            We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2022. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.
        </p>

        <h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
        <!--
            [Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix.

            You must carry out an assessment before claiming disproportionate burden.

            Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.

            These are examples only. Your statement should be specific to your website.]
        --
        <p><strong>Navigation and accessing information</strong>
            There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).
            
            It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.
            
            It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.
            
            We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].
        </p>

        <h3>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
        <!--
            [Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.]
        --
        <p><strong>PDFs and other documents</strong>
            The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document].
            
            Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
            
            <strong>Live video</strong>
            We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
